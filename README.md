SHARE is a website/interface which allows users to neatly organize their links, projects and files in a clear and concise manner. Currently most websites provide user access to files on their own server and format files are disorganized and not user friendly. SHARE will make life easier by reducing how much users have to jump back and forth between websites searching for projects and documents. The target audience are users who use services like Dropbox or GitHub for storage or online collaborative work that would like an organized way to share and maintain these projects. SHARE will have one main menu with many different features such as creating different groups, creating sections/headers, searching for files. Regulars can access, share and upload links, projects and files through URLs or their local storage to the server. Admins can view and remove the same things but will not be able to share or upload anything to the server unless they make their own regular user account.

List of features for SHARE: 
	Create a personal account for personal files 
	Link files from websites like Dropbox, Github, Google Drive, etc 
	Create groups to collaborate with others 
	Create sections, headers to organize, categorize and rearrange files 
	Search for certain files or users
	
Visualize&Plan is a canvas that provides users multiple tools designed specifically to help them plan out projects using images. Currently there is no application that primarily solves this issue. Apps such as “Reminders” on the phone contain tools that assist user in planning, but the primary focus is not designed specifically for planning. Visualize&Plan will make life easier by providing tools designed specifically for planning. The target audience are users who need to plan a project and are visual thinkers. Visualize&Plan will have many individual features but one main menu containing all these features. Regulars are able to upload images which can be dragged, resized, cropped and named. They are also able to make multiple canvas boards for different projects. Admins are able to see all canvases and can edit or delete them.
 
List of features for Visualize&Plan: 
	Create a personal account 
	Upload images from URL or local storage onto a canvas board 
	Create multiple canvas boards 
	Drag, resize and crop images 
	Naming the canvas and images 
	Share canvas boards to other users
	
GMSports is a simple and interactive online web application which allows a group of users to play a fantasy sports game with current existing teams. Currently there are many fantasy sports applications but can be difficult for beginners to understand as you draft your own players, so this application has pre-set existing teams. Existing fantasy sport applications also only last for one season, while GMSports will allow users to play a long term game. The target audience are sports fans who would like to use their knowledge of the sport in a competitive and fun manner. This project will have one main menu which will branch off to different sections such as stats, rankings and settings. As a regular you are able to trade players, create groups, and see stats and rankings, while admins can change the scoring system, veto trades.

List of features for GMSports:
	Create a personal account 
	View user’s players, stats and rankings 
	Projected stats of players and teams 
	Trade with other users 
	Join and create leagues 
	A point system allowing teams to pick up better players (different teams have different points depending on current ranking) 
	Updating player database as there are new draft classes each year
